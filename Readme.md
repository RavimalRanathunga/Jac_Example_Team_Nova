# Jac Example Program

## Introduction
This is an example program written in the Jac programming language. This README will guide you through cloning the repository, creating a virtual environment, and installing the Jac language.

## Prerequisites
- Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
- Ensure you have Git installed on your system.

## Cloning the Repository
1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Clone the repository from GitHub:
   ```

1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```
2. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

## Installing Jac Language
1. With the virtual environment activated, install Jac using pip:
   ```
   pip install jac
   ```

## Running the Example Program
1. Ensure you are still in the virtual environment.
2. Run the Jac program:
   ```
   jac run main.jac
   ```

## Conclusion
You have successfully cloned the repository, set up a virtual environment, and installed the Jac programming language. You can now modify and run the example program as needed.
